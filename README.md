# Unified Sanctuaries

> *A Living Blueprint for Regenerative Living & Community Resilience*

**Unified Sanctuaries** is a regenerative, community-owned ecosystem integrating community living, permaculture farming, wellness, and education. Grounded in equity, diverse perspectives, and Indigenous wisdom, it is an open-source hub for experimentation, designed to cultivate collaboration and catalyze solutions around building a more regenerative and abundant future for all.

## Vision

A vibrant, regenerative future where communities live in harmony with the Earth and each other through four interconnected platforms:

- **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** - Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, and hands-on learning
- **Retreat & Healing Arts Center** - Restoration, creative expression, holistic therapies, and a bathhouse/spa
- **Event Venue** - Gathering space for knowledge-sharing, artistic collaboration, and cultural events
- **Community Living Space** - Village supporting shared stewardship and cooperative living (20+ homes)

## Core Philosophy

- Non-speculative land stewardship
- Earned equity through contribution (not just capital)
- Participatory governance with the Anchor Circle model
- Circular economy with community currency (Unified Token)
- Open-source blueprint for replication

## Status

**Phase**: Pre-acquisition / Planning
**Location Focus**: Southern Vermont (Brattleboro / Guilford / Putney)
**Next Steps**: Land acquisition, trust/entity structuring, community building
