# Unified Sanctuaries

> *A Living Blueprint for Regenerative Living & Community Resilience*

**Unified Sanctuaries** is a regenerative, community-owned ecosystem integrating community living, permaculture farming, wellness, and education. Grounded in equity, diverse perspectives, and Indigenous wisdom, it is an open-source hub for experimentation, designed to cultivate collaboration and catalyze solutions around building a more regenerative and abundant future for all.

## Vision

A vibrant, regenerative future where communities live in harmony with the Earth and each other through four interconnected platforms:

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** | Regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, and hands-on learning through workshops and agritourism |
| **Retreat & Healing Arts Center** | Restoration, creative expression, holistic therapies, bathhouse/spa, and accessible wellness programming |
| **Event Venue** | Gathering space for festivals, workshops, weddings, and cultural events with professional AV support |
| **Community Living Space** | Village of 20+ homes supporting shared stewardship, cooperative living, and diverse housing options |

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Non-speculative land stewardship** - Land is held in trust, removed from the market permanently
- **Earned equity through contribution** - Build ownership through labor, skills, and participation—not just capital
- **Participatory governance** - Decisions flow from those most affected through the Anchor Circle model
- **Circular economy** - Community currency (Unified Token) reduces cash dependency and rewards contribution
- **Open-source blueprint** - Everything we learn is documented and shared for other communities to replicate
