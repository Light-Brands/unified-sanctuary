## **Seeking Trust & Entity Structuring Expert (Pre-acquisition | VT land project: residential \+ commons / enterprises)**

**Unified Sanctuaries** is a Vermont-based land stewardship and community living project in the **planning / pre-acquisition phase**. We’re currently assembling the right legal and financial architecture *before* we move forward with acquisition.

**First step:** we want an expert to **review our project vision/overview document** and help us translate the vision into a **sound trust \+ entity structure** that will be legible to lenders, insurers, and grantors.

### **What we’re building (two-realm model)**

We are designing a land project with two distinct realms:

* **Residential / Living Realm:** primarily homes \+ friends visiting, with privacy, stability, and shared infrastructure (roads, water/septic, microgrid).  
* **Commons / Enterprise Realm:** public-facing programming and enterprises including **events, a campground, retreats, and mission-aligned businesses**.

### **What we need help with**

We’re seeking guidance to design a structure that is:

* **Non-speculative** and mission-locked (land stewarded long-term)  
* Attractive and clear for **banking, accounting, and underwriting**  
* Compatible with **grants/donations** (where appropriate) and lender financing  
* Designed for **high-activity / higher-liability** commons uses (events, businesses, \+ campground), with strong liability containment  
* Supportive of **earned stake** through contributions (including non-cash contributions) with **clean exit/liquidation pathways**  
* Built to **avoid securities risk** (no “investment-like units”)

### **What we’re exploring**

We’re comparing several pathways and want help evaluating feasibility and tradeoffs (especially as we select land and phase the project):

* Land-holding approaches: **CLT-style nonprofit**, **purpose/stewardship trust**, or other mission-locked models  
* Whether to use **one landholder with two realm leases** vs **two landholders** (Residential landholder \+ Commons landholder)  
* If two landholders: real estate separation options such as **subdivision**, **planned community / site condo**, or **airspace lots \+ reciprocal easement agreements**  
* Governance structures that align with responsibility-based stewardship while remaining lender-legible (co-op / membership association / steward council models)  
* Earned stake mechanisms like **limited-equity home resale formulas**, **capital accounts**, and/or **member loans**

### **Scope (what success looks like)**

After reviewing our vision document, we’d like:

* A clear recommendation: **1 preferred structure** (plus 1–2 viable alternates) with pros/cons  
* A list of required entities and **who does what** (landholder, governance body, operating entities)  
* A practical roadmap: what to set up **before land acquisition**, what can wait until after  
* Key documents we’ll need (ground leases, master leases, governance charter, shared infrastructure agreement, capital account/loan policy, insurance requirements)  
* Risks and watch-outs (tax, liability, banking, securities posture), and how to mitigate them  
* Optional: introductions to aligned VT counsel / CLT professionals / lenders / insurers

### **Ideal background**

* Deep experience with trusts and entity structuring (CLTs, purpose/stewardship trusts, private trusts, land trusts, co-ops, mutual benefit orgs, nonprofit/public benefit structures, mixed-use land projects)  
* Ability to translate complex legal concepts into **plain language** for a project team  
* Familiarity with VT (experience coordinating with VT counsel)

### **Engagement**

Open to hourly or a defined short project (document review \+ recommendation memo \+ call).  
Please include:

* relevant past projects (land trusts/CLTs/co-ops/mixed-use)  
* your location/licensure (if applicable)  
* availability \+ rate

**To inquire:** reply with a brief summary of your relevant experience and any links/examples.

**Experience note:** We’re looking for someone bringing deep, real-world experience in trusts and entity structuring—not primarily relying on GPT/AI to source answers. We’ve used GPT extensively and found it helpful for ideation and drafting, but for this phase we need an expert with a proven track record who can apply judgment, context, and lived experience to our specific situation.
