## **About Me / The Crew**

I’ve spent the past several years working at the intersection of **community building, land stewardship, education, and regenerative living**. My background is in hands-on work \- organizing educational and healing arts-focused gatherings, supporting regenerative land-based projects, fundraising, running businesses, and co-creating spaces where care for the earth and care for one another are inseparable.

I’ve lived in and worked alongside **intentional communities, farms, and grassroots initiatives**, and have experience with:

* permaculture and regenerative land practices  
* natural building and infrastructure development  
* hosting educational gatherings and healing arts retreats  
* collaborative governance structures / shared decision-making processes  
* stewarding projects with long-term vision rather than short-term extraction

The people involved in this project are practical, grounded, and values-aligned \- builders, engineers, growers, organizers, creatives, wellness practitioners, and caregivers who understand that healthy communities take time, trust, and clear agreements.

We’re seeking a place to **put down roots**, care for the land over the long term, and create something that can support everyday living, shared purpose, and the wider community living nearby.

This search is coming from a place of **readiness, responsibility, and commitment** and from a deep respect for Earth, and her local context. 

Thank you in advance for your support\!
