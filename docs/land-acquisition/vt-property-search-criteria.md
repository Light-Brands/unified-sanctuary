**Objectives**: Purchase a property that can support the development of a residential community (10+ homes / tiny homes), and communal amenities, as well as a farm, farm stand, cafe, storefront, campground, venue for rent for events, and a retreat center. 

**What we’re looking for in a property:** 

* 3+ bedroom home on site (running water, electricity, & wifi)   
* 50+ acres (open to 30+ acres)  
* Farmable soil  
* Road access  
* Ample parking (for 100+ cars)  
* ***Mixed use zoning (residential, agricultural, educational, commercial, storefront, etc.)***  
* Low noise exposure \- low change of noise complaints from neighbors for loud music  
* ***Natural water source*** onsite where we can swim, e.g. stream, river, lake, pond  
* Limited conservation restrictions   
* ***Ability to build on land***   
* Within a 15-minute drive from a grocery store, convenience store, and gas station

**Locations** we’re interested in (b/c of town zoning and culture, and b/c there are existing communities / projects in these towns that align with our vision):

* Brattelboro, VT \- \#1 choice  
* Guildford, VT \- \#2 choice  
* Putney, VT \- \#3 choice 

\*\*Please do NOT send us properties on the market in other nearby locations unless you know that the town zoning aligns with our objectives. 

**Timeline**: We would like to close on a property by mid March as we need to move out of our rental in Brattleboro, VT, by early April. 

**Other factors to consider:** We learned that the USDA is giving out loans to people who want to farm on land zoned as “rural” \- so this is another factor to consider (land located in “rural” areas is a better fit)

**Financials**: We can put down $180K in cash and looking for owner financing; can make monthly payments of \~ $2k to pay off a mortgage.  

**About me:** 

* I’m the Executive Director of a foundation; my annual income is $80K / year (full time for 1.5 years, part time before that for 0.5 years)  
* The cash to put down on the property is being contributed from a family trust   
* I have good credit   
* I have not yet gotten pre-approval for a loan from my bank. I’ll do that early next week. 

**Info we’d like to know about properties that fulfill our criteria:** 

* Can the land be parceled? Cost to parcel?   
* How close by are the neighbors and what are they like?   
* Has the land been farmed on in the past?
