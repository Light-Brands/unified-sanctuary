  
My name is Sydney, and I live in Southern Vermont at a small intentional community where I’m currently renting my home.

For the past 5 years I’ve been organizing hands-on, educational gatherings across New England with Permatours \- a nonprofit I co-founded. These events focus on regenerating land, practicing permaculture (integrating with the earth’s natural rhythms), and building structures with natural building materials \- bringing people together to learn, co-create, grow food, share stories, and deepen our connection with Earth and one another.

I’m writing with a heartfelt invitation: **Do you or someone you know own land in the Brattleboro or Guildford area that isn’t currently being lived on or tended to, and might be open to conversations about how the land could be stewarded for the long term?**

With a group of close collaborators, we’re co-creating “Unified Sanctuaries" \- an evolving blueprint for community living, regeneration, healing, and connection that we’re excited to ground here in Southern, VT. Our vision weaves together:

* **Permaculture farming & education:** restoring soils, cultivating self-sustaining food systems, and teaching land-based practices  
* **Retreat & healing arts spaces**: nature-based wellness, cultural programming, and a farm-to-table cafe  
* **Community living:** shared stewardship and long-term land trust governance  
* **Events & creative expression**: immersive gatherings, workshops, and cultural celebrations

Our crew has the practical skills to build what we’re envisioning \- from permaculture systems and natural buildings to governance and decision making processes \- plus, the lived experience to teach others these practices. 

We’re seeking 50-100+ acres with a natural water source and room for tiny homes, gardens, community infrastructure, and parking \- a place where our vision can take root. We’re open to purchasing land outright, offering a down payment with monthly payments, or exploring creative financing and partnership models.

If this vision resonates, I’d love to connect and, it feels aligned for the both of us, walk the land together.
