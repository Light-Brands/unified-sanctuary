## **UNIFIED SANCTUARIES / SOL OVERVIEW 1/2/26**

Unified Sanctuaries / Sol is an evolving, land-based project rooted in:

* meeting basic human needs (food, water, shelter, belonging / community)  
* regenerative land stewardship  
* shared enterprise and livelihood  
* non-speculative, long-term community stability  
  * **Non-speculative:** The land/housing **isn’t treated like an investment vehicle** to flip for profit. Value increases aren’t meant to be captured privately (or at least they’re constrained), so the place doesn’t become a playground for real-estate speculation.  
  * **Long-term community stability:** The structure is designed so people can **count on staying** \- with predictable costs, clear rules for joining/leaving, and governance/ownership models that **protect affordability and continuity** across decades (not just whoever has money at the moment).

*We’re building a place to live and steward together \- not a property to cash out on \- and we want it to remain resilient, affordable, and coherent over time.*

This document exists to:

* share a living framework  
* make intentions clear  
* set shared expectations  
* establish pathways for belonging, contribution, and care

This is **not** a finished operating agreement.

## **Intention for Land Stewardship, Living, Belonging & Shared Enterprise 🌱**

## **Overall Structure: One Land, Two Distinct Realms of Use**

1. **Residential / Living Realm**

2. **Community Enterprise / Commons Realm**

Both realms are **actively stewarded**, cared for, and tended \- the distinction is about **use, governance, and liability.** 

## **1\. Residential & Living Realm (Private Dwellings \+ Shared Communal Amenities)**

This land is intended for **housing, daily life, and basic human needs**, while allowing for creative expression and livelihood pathways if residents choose.

**Includes:**

* Private dwellings (homes built or owned by individuals)  
* Space for trusted friends and collaborators to live on-site  
* A shared amenities zone that supports:  
  * People with minimal infrastructure  
  * Tiny homes / van travelers  
  * Visiting collaborators and guests

**Shared amenities may include:**

* Indoor / outdoor kitchen  
* Bathroom / showers  
* Laundry  
* Parking for vans, tiny homes, guests

**Residents *may* also choose to:**

* Host learning experiences  
* Share ways of living  
* Provide workshops, tours, or other offerings (participation in enterprise here is **optional)**

**Renting Homes on the Residential Side**

* Residents who build or steward homes **may rent them** out to those who are approved by current residents  
* Approval is guided by:  
  * the input and consent process of current residents  
  * alignment with our shared agreements, values, & policies  
  * the residential site’s current capacity (housing, resources, and stewardship needs)

This allows:

* flexibility for residents during travel or life changes   
* continuity of care for the land and infrastructure  
* Access and affordable housing for aligned people 

### **Residential Community Pool of Funds**

#### **Contributions**

* A **percentage of rental income and other residential income** flows into the residential community fund  
* Working range (to be refined collectively): **5–15%** 

#### **Use of Funds**

The residential community fund supports:

* Maintenance and improvements of shared amenities  
* Infrastructure upgrades  
* Land care and stewardship  
* Emergency or mutual aid needs within the residential community

Funds are **not extracted for private gain** and are stewarded collectively by active residents.

The intention here is **dignified living**, privacy, stability, safety, and mutual respect. 

#### **Residents are responsible for:**

* Personal insurance for their homes (as applicable)  
* Liability related to private activities

**Shared amenities are:**

* Covered by appropriate communal insurance  
* Governed by shared use agreements

### **Traveler & Visitor Use of Shared Amenities**

Residents are welcome to host trusted friends and visitors, while also ensuring shared resources are respected, cared for, and used sustainably.

#### **Short Stays (Up to 5 Days)**

* Visitors staying **5 days or fewer** may use shared amenities:  
  * Kitchen  
  * Bathroom / showers  
  * Laundry  
  * Parking

* Use is offered:  
  * By invitation  
  * In alignment with shared agreements

* No required fee, though **voluntary contributions** are welcome

#### **Extended Stays (More Than 5 Days)**

Visitors staying **longer than 5 days** are asked to contribute to shared upkeep:

* **Daily or weekly amenity-use fee**, or  
* **Work-trade / contribution exchange**, when appropriate and mutually agreed upon

#### **What the Fee Supports**

* Water, electricity, and supplies  
* Maintenance and cleaning  
* Wear-and-tear on shared infrastructure  
* Contributions to the **Residential Community Pool of Funds**

### **Fee Structure (Working Concept)**

* Fees are:  
  * Sliding-scale   
  * Clearly communicated up front  
  * Reviewed periodically by residents

* Reduced or waived fees may be offered for:  
  * Active contributors  
  * Short-term helpers  
  * Special circumstances

#### **Alignment & Respect for the Space**

* Extended stays require:  
  * Resident awareness and consent  
  * Respect for shared rhythms and capacity  
* Repeated or long-term stays may:  
  * Transition into provisional residency  
  * Include clearer agreements around contribution

#### **Guiding Principle**

**Hospitality is held with care, not at the expense of those who live here.**  
Shared resources are sustained by shared responsibility.

## **2\. Community Enterprise / Commons Land**

This land, adjacent to the residential land, is envisioned as being **owned and stewarded by the wider community through membership**, with clear structures for participation and decision-making.

This land will support **shared enterprises, food production / systems, cultural spaces, regenerative livelihoods, and service to the bioregion in which we reside.**

**Potential community land offerings include:**

* Farm & gardens  
* Farm stand  
* Café  
* Retreat, healing arts center, & bathhouse  
* Campground  
* Event & gathering venue

**Key principle:**

* The land itself is not owned by individuals or businesses  
* Enterprises **rent or lease land/use rights** from the community (trust)  
* Each enterprise contributes 5-15% of earnings into a **shared community fund**

**This community pool of funds will support:**

* Land care & maintenance  
* Shared infrastructure  
* Community needs  
* Long-term contributor pay-outs (described below)

**Enterprises operating on the land:**

* Are responsible for their own taxes  
* Pay rent and revenue contributions as operating expenses  
* Maintains its own insurance (general liability, workers comp if applicable)  
* Operates as a legally distinct entity where required

**The land-holding entity / trust:**

* Maintains insurance covering land ownership and leasing

**Revenue contributions to the community pool:**

* May be treated as lease fees, program fees, or cooperative contributions depending on structure

## **Areas of Participation & Decision-Making**

The community is organized around **distinct pillars**, each with its own focus, rhythm, and governance.

**Example pillars include:**

* Farm including a farm stand, cafe, farm stand, nursery, and compost operation  
* Retreat & healing arts, including a bathhouse, a storefront, & a campground  
* Event & venue operations  
* Living space including private dwellings, communal space, &  amenities for visitors 

### **Decision-Making Is Role-Based**

* People **earn decision-making power over time** through involvement  
* Contributors participate in decisions **within the pillar they’re actively involved in and supporting**  
* No one votes on or influences areas they are not involved in, except for the anchor circle (more on that below)

This ensures decisions are:

* Informed  
* Grounded  
* Made by those closest to the work

## **Anchor Circle (Guiding Center)**

To ensure coherence across all pillars, there is a **guiding center called an anchor circle**:

* A **rotating, elected / nominated body**  
* Changes by:  
  * Season or other time period  
* Members rotate per their level of involvement in the community and per community input

**Role of the Anchor Circle:**

* Hold shared values and long-term vision  
* Support alignment across pillars  
* Address cross-pillar tensions or needs  
* Steward land-level and community-wide decisions

### **Double-Linking To Support Fluid Communication into and out of the Anchor Circle**

* Each pillar selects:  
  * One person to bring insights *from the pillar to the anchor*

* The anchor circle also designates:  
  * A liaison that represents each pillar to bring clarity *from the anchor back to that relevant pillar*

This creates **two-way flow**, transparency, and shared understanding \- rather than top-down control.

## **Trustees / Trust Managers (Distinct but Overlapping with Anchor Circle)**

* Trustees:

  * Safeguard the land and long-term intent  
  * Cannot personally profit from land appreciation

* Trust Managers:

  * Handle fiduciary and administrative duties  
  * May overlap with Anchor Circle members for continuity

### **Overlap Is Intentional**

* Some individuals may serve in **dual roles**, but:  
* No single group holds total control / checks and balances are embedded

## **Influence Is Tied to Active Participation**

Decision-making power is **earned and maintained through presence and contribution**.

### **Core Principle:** Influence follows involvement

* Members who are:  
  * Less present  
  * No longer actively contributing  
  * Stepping back from stewardship  
     gradually **lose decision-making influence**

* This includes:  
  * Voting rights  
  * Pillar-level influence  
  * Anchor-circle eligibility

Influence can be:

* Paused  
* Reduced  
* Re-earned through renewed engagement

This prevents:

* Dormant control  
* Legacy power without responsibility  
* Decisions being made by those no longer close to the work

## **Active vs. Dormant Membership States** 

Membership may exist in **states**, such as:

* **Active Member** – full participation and influence  
* **Resting Member** – retains belonging, reduced influence  
* **Former Member** – no governance role, exit pathway applies

Transitions between states are:

* Transparent  
* Communicated  
* Guided by shared agreements, not punishment

This approach:

* Rewards care, not extraction  
* Keeps decision-making grounded in lived reality  
* Protects the land and community from drift  
* Allows people to step back *without destabilizing the whole*

It reflects a simple truth:

Communities stay healthy when responsibility and influence move together.

## **Trust Types Being Explored** 

Possible structures to explore:

* Community land trust (CLT)  
* Cooperative land trust  
* Steward-ownership trust  
* Hybrid trust \+ cooperative entity

What matters most:

* Land cannot be sold for speculation  
* Participating community members have real influence  
* Stewardship is protected across generations

## **Option A: Community Land Trust (CLT)**

*(Best fit for the Community Enterprise / Commons Land)*

### **What It Is**

A nonprofit entity that:

* Owns land permanently  
* Separates land ownership from buildings/businesses  
* Exists explicitly to prevent speculation

### **Why It Fits**

* The CLT owns the **community land**  
* Enterprises lease land from the CLT  
* Members participate in governance  
* Land cannot be sold or flipped  
* Built-in affordability \+ permanence

### **Community Payouts**

* CLTs **can support payouts**, but:  
  * Not through land resale  
  * Through:  
    * Lease revenue  
    * Enterprise contributions  
    * Community funds

* Payouts are typically:  
  * Capped  
  * Time-based  
  * Book-value or contribution-based

### **Governance Fit**

* Strong alignment with:  
  * Anchor Circle  
  * Pillar-based decision-making  
  * Community fund governance

CLT \= *excellent* for land you want to protect for generations while supporting enterprises and community benefits

## 

## **Option B: Stewardship Trust / Purpose Trust**

*(Best fit for the Residential Land)*

### **What It Is**

A trust that:

* Holds assets for a defined purpose  
* Does not exist to maximize profit  
* Can hold land and set use rules permanently

### **Why It Fits**

* The trust owns the **residential land**  
* Residents own / control their homes  
* Homes can be sold to approved incoming residents  
* Land remains permanently non-speculative

### **Community Payouts**

* Payouts come from:  
  * Rental income  
  * Shared infrastructure fees  
  * Community fund contributions

* Residents can:  
  * Receive payouts upon exit  
  * Or choose to **donate their payout back to the community pool**

This aligns beautifully with:

* People needing liquidity at life transitions  
* Others wanting to “gift forward” their contribution

### **Governance Fit**

* Trustees \+ resident representatives  
* Clear agreements about:  
  * Exit  
  * Succession  
  * Approval of incoming residents

Stewardship Trust \= *excellent* for residential stability \+ dignity without privatizing land

---

## **Option C: Cooperative-Owned Entity (Co-op Trust Hybrid)**

*(Best fit when you want member-ownership \+ payouts)*

### **What It Is**

A cooperative (or cooperative trust) where:

* Members hold ownership shares  
* Shares are tied to use and contribution  
* Profits are shared or reinvested

### **Why It Fits**

* Allows members to:  
  * Build equity over time  
  * Receive patronage or exit payouts

* Shares are:  
  * Redeemable at book value  
  * Not tradable on open markets

### **Community Payouts**

* Very strong support for:  
  * Ongoing payouts  
  * Exit payouts  
  * Monthly distributions  
  *   
* Members can often choose:  
  * Cash payout  
  * Reinvestment into community pool

### **Caveat**

* Co-ops alone don’t always protect land from speculation  
* Best when paired with:  
  * A trust or CLT that owns the land  
  * The co-op leases land long-term

**Bottom line:**  
Co-op \= *excellent* for equity, liquidity, and member benefit \- **not** ideal alone for land protection.

### **✔️ What a Co-op *Can* Do Well**

A cooperative **can**:

* Have **members that are different entity types**, including:  
  * Individuals  
  * For-profit businesses (LLCs, corporations)  
  * Nonprofits  
  * Other cooperatives  
  * Informal collectives (represented by individuals or entities)

* **Own or partially own other entities**, such as:  
  * LLCs (common)  
  * Subsidiary co-ops  
  * Operating companies

* Act as:

  * A **shared ownership layer**  
  * A **governance and coordination hub**  
  * A **profit-sharing / surplus-allocation mechanism**  
  * A **holder of shared assets** (non-land, usually)

This is often called a **multi-stakeholder cooperative** or a **federated cooperative model**.

### **What a Co-op Does *Not* Do**

A single co-op entity generally should **not**:

* Directly operate:  
  * A nonprofit program **and**  
  * A for-profit business **and**  
  * Hold land **and**  
  * Run all enterprises all inside one legal body

Why?

* Tax complications  
* Liability spillover  
* Conflicting fiduciary duties  
* Loss of clarity and protections

### **A multi-stakeholder cooperative sitting above diverse entities is:**

* Aligned with regenerative economics  
* Proven in Mondragón-style systems  
* Flexible enough to evolve  
* Legible to lawyers, lenders, and funders

### **Why A Co-op Fits Your Vision Perfectly**

Your system involves:

* Pillars with autonomy  
* Clear boundaries between land, living, and enterprise  
* Shared surplus without land speculation  
* Exit pathways and payouts

A cooperative can hold and coordinate many different kinds of entities as members \- including for-profits, nonprofits, and other co-ops. It works best as a shared ownership and governance layer, not as a single container for everything.

## **Or A Hybrid Structure**

### **Community Enterprise / Commons Land**

* **Land owner:** Community Land Trust  
* **Operating entities:** Member co-ops / LLCs / collectives  
* **Revenue flow:**  
  * Rent → CLT  
  * % of revenue → Community Pool

* **Payouts:** From Community Pool (monthly, capped, time-based)

### **Residential Land**

* **Land owner:** Stewardship / Purpose Trust  
* **Homes:** Individually owned or controlled  
* **Equity:** Contribution-based, non-speculative  
* **Exit:**  
  * Sell home to approved resident  
  * Or receive payout over time  
  * Option to donate payout to community pool  
  * Or partial payout & partial community gift 

*“The land is held in trust so it can never be sold for profit. People earn stability, influence, and fair compensation through contribution \- not through speculation. When someone leaves, they’re supported, and the land remains protected for those who come next.”*

#### (MORE AT BOTTOM OF DOC)

## **Membership Types (Working Language)**

These names are flexible, but intended to clarify pathways:

**Resident Members** – live on the land; steward homes and shared amenities

**Pillar Stewards** – actively contribute to a specific pillar (e.g. farm vs. retreat center, etc.)

**Enterprise Members** – run or co-run businesses using community land

**Commons Contributors** – support land care, infrastructure, or systems

### **1\. Resident Members**

* Live on the residential land  
* Steward their home and shared living infrastructure  
* Earn equity through contribution (see below)  
* Cannot sell land  
* Can sell their home to an approved incoming resident  
* Can rent their home to approved renters (approval by existing residents)  
* Acceptance of new members requires consent of existing residents

### **2\. Pillar Stewards**

* Actively contribute to a specific enterprise or land-based pillar (e.g. farm, retreat center, venue for events, living area, etc)  
* Participate in governance and decisions for that pillar  
* Build long-term stake through contribution and responsibility

### **3\. Enterprise Members**

* Run or co-run businesses on the community enterprise realm  
* Lease land/use rights from the community  
* Contribute a percentage of revenue to the shared community fund  
* Participate in pillar-level governance

### **4\. Commons Contributors**

* Support land care, infrastructure, maintenance, or shared systems  
* May not run businesses but contribute labor, skill, products / services, or coordination  
* Earn recognition and stake through contribution

### **Possible Decision-Making Methods (By Pillar Choice)**

Each pillar may choose one or blend several approaches, such as:

* **Consent-based decision-making \-** a decision moves forward unless there is a reasoned objection  
* **Consensus \-** used for values-level or long-term commitments)  
* **Voting \-** used for operational or time-sensitive matters)  
* **Delegated authority \-** trusted stewards empowered to decide within defined bounds)

The method chosen must be:

* Clear  
* Transparent  
* Communicated to all pillar members

## **Membership Pathways & Vetting (How Belonging Is Earned)**

Membership is **earned through presence, contribution, and trust**, not by financial buy-in.

### **Blooming Period** 

* New participants enter as **Provisional Contributors**  
* A “blooming” period allows time to:  
  * Build relationships  
  * Demonstrate reliability  
  * Understand values and agreements  
* Typical duration:  
  * 6–18 months (flexible per the situation / person and how well they are known by community members)

### **During the Blooming Period:**

* Individuals can contribute through:  
  * Labor  
  * Stewardship  
  * Program delivery  
  * Enterprise development

* They do **not yet hold ownership or voting rights**

### **Membership Readiness Is Assessed By:**

* Resident members (for residential pathways)  
* Pillar stewards (for enterprise pathways)  
* Anchor Circle (for overall alignment)

Membership is granted when there is **felt alignment, not just technical completion**.

### **Paid vs Earned Membership Pathways**

Two Primary Ways to Become a Member:

#### **1\. Earned Membership**

* Gained through:  
  * Consistent contribution  
  * Stewardship  
  * Labor, leadership, or value creation  
* Follows a **blooming / provisional period**  
* Ideal for:  
  * Residents  
  * Builders  
  * Stewards  
  * Long-term collaborators

### **2\. Paid Membership (By Invitation Only)**

* Available **only to vetted, aligned individuals or enterprises**  
* Requires:  
  * Values alignment  
  * Approval through community process  
* Paid membership:  
  * Does *not* bypass contribution expectations  
  * Often complements active involvement rather than replacing it

Payment alone never guarantees:

* Decision-making power  
* Long-term stake  
* Equity

## **Who Decides Who Gets Membership:**

* Entry decisions are **shared**, not unilateral:  
  * Residents weigh in on residential members  
  * Pillar circles weigh in on pillar members  
  * Anchor Circle ensures overall coherence

* Final approval happens when:  
  * There is no major objection  
  * Concerns have been addressed through dialogue

## **What “Equity” & Ownership Means Here** 

Equity **does not mean owning the land outright**.

Equity represents:

* Long-term stability  
* Recognition of real contribution  
* The right to a fair payout upon exit  
* A voice in governance *within one’s sphere of involvement*

Equity is **earned** and is tied to:

* Value contributed  
* Time stewarding  
* Responsibility held

Equity may confer:

* Stability of place (housing or enterprise continuity)  
* Eligibility for payout upon exit  
* Influence within relevant decision-making spaces  
* Deeper participation in stewardship and governance

Equity **does not** automatically grant:

* Authority over areas someone is not involved in  
* Permanent voting power regardless of participation  
* Control over land as a speculative asset

## **How the Community “Owns” & Stewards**

The community’s relationship to the Community Enterprise & Commons Realm is based on **shared ownership, stewardship, and decision-making \- not individual land speculation**.

This means **the land is not an asset to flip, extract value from, or profit off through rising market prices.**

* No individual can buy the land cheap and sell it later at a higher price for personal gain  
* Land value increases (due to community effort, stewardship, or market shifts) **do not accrue to individuals**  
* Land is treated as:  
  * A shared, living commons  
  * A place to meet needs and generate livelihoods  
  * Not a speculative investment vehicle

### **What *Can* Be Exchanged**

* Homes, structures, or improvements people build  
* Businesses or enterprises (subject to community agreements)  
* Membership interests or equity **at book value or contribution value**, not market appreciation

### **What *Cannot* Be Exchanged**

* The underlying land itself  
* Land appreciation captured privately

### **Why This Matters**

* Prevents displacement  
* Protects affordability  
* Ensures the land remains accessible to future stewards  
* Keeps the focus on **use-value, not exchange-value**

*“The land is held for use and care, not for profit.”*

### **Land-Holding Structure** 

* The land is held by a **dedicated land-holding entity** (exact structure to be finalized)  
* This entity:  
  * Owns the land on behalf of the community  
  * Leases land-use rights to enterprises and programs  
  * Protects the land from sale or speculation  
* Community members do not individually own parcels of land  
* Instead, they hold **membership-based ownership interests** in the entity that stewards the land

This allows:

* Long-term land protection  
* Clear liability boundaries  
* Community control without fragmentation

## **Community Ownership Rights & Benefits**

Community members gain **tangible benefits**, even without individual land deeds.

### **Ownership & Membership Benefits May Include:**

* **Decision-making power** within the pillar(s) they participate in  
*   
* **Voting rights** on:  
  * Use of the community pool of funds (accrued per businesses operating onsite contributing a percentage of their earnings)  
  * New enterprises or initiatives  
  * Land stewardship priorities

* **Access benefits**, such as:  
  * Priority access to excess food grown on the farm  
  * Priority access to campground   
  * Discounted tickets to events, retreats, and gatherings  
  * Shared infrastructure  
  *   
* **Stability benefits**, including:  
  * Long-term access to land-based resources  
  * Reduced cost of living via shared systems

* **Influence over how resources serve**:  
  * The immediate community  
  * The surrounding bioregion (food access, education, regeneration)  
  *   
* **Eligibility to:**  
  * Earn equity  
  * Participate in governance  
  * Influence use of the community pool of funds

Ownership here is about **belonging, influence, and shared prosperity**, not extraction.

### **Communal Land Use Fees**

Use of land within the **Community Enterprise & Commons Realm** includes **two distinct obligations**, designed to balance fairness, access, and long-term stewardship.

### **1\. Land Rental Rate**

* Any person or business using community land pays a **rental rate**  
* Rental rates help cover:  
  * Land costs  
  * Taxes and insurance  
  * Shared infrastructure and maintenance  
* **Members receive reduced rental rates**  
* **Non-members pay higher rates**

This structure creates:

* An incentive to become a member  
* A clear benefit to long-term contributors  
* Protection against extractive or short-term use

Rental rates may vary by:

* Type of use (farm vs café vs venue, etc.)  
* Footprint on the land  
* Seasonality  
* Infrastructure intensity

### **2\. Percentage of Revenue to the Community Pool**

In addition to rent:

* Enterprises contribute a **percentage of gross revenue** to the community pool  
* Early working range: **5–15%**  
  * Percentage may vary by:  
    * Enterprise maturity  
    * Capital intensity  
    * Profit margins  
* This contribution:  
  * Is separate from rent  
  * Scales with success  
  * Aligns prosperity with collective benefit  
* Contributions are transparent and reviewed periodically

Together, **rent \+ revenue contribution** ensure:

* Baseline stability for the land  
* Shared upside when enterprises thrive

### **Community Fund Uses:**

* Land care & ecological restoration  
* Shared infrastructure & maintenance  
* Community programming & access  
* Bioregional initiatives beyond the land  
* Contributor pay-outs upon exit, if contributor cannot be paid immediately / in totality but still wants to help (see below)

## **Contribution → Equity (Residential Land)**

Trusted friends and collaborators may live on-site with a pathway to equity.

**Example pathway:**

* Commit to contributing **$20,000+ of value over a one year period,** such as:  
  * Building a home or shared infrastructure  
  * Creating revenue-generating offerings  
  * Supporting land development or operations

Once that value is **delivered**, equity is earned.

## **Exit Security / Liquidation Upon Exit & Pay-Outs**

This is a core value.

### **Who May Receive Pay-Outs:**

* Resident Members  
* Pillar Stewards  
* Enterprise Members  
* Commons Contributors (depending on contribution level)

### **Who Cannot Liquidate:**

* Short-term participants  
* Visitors  
* Provisional contributors who exit during blooming

### **How Pay-Outs Work:**

* Pay-outs come from the community fund  
* Distributed over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc)  
* Designed to:  
  * Honor contribution  
  * Protect community continuity  
* Members exiting cannot sell the land they tended or lived on  
* Sometimes people *can* sell what they build, such as a home they built for themselves  
* Sometimes what is built is **integrated into the community** and cannot be sold independently  
  * In these cases:  
    * The community compensates contributors over time  
    * Pay-outs come from the **shared community fund**  
    * Payments may be monthly or staged  
    * No one can extract the full fund at once \- the land and community must remain healthy

The goal:

* No one leaves empty-handed  
* No sudden destabilization of the community  
* Fair payout over time rather than extraction in a moment

## **Separation of Living vs. Enterprise / Commons Stewarded Land**

This separation of living and enterprise allows for:

* Clear governance  
* Reduced liability  
* Stability for residents  
* Operational continuity if something happens in one area  
* Less risk for residents if a business struggles  
* Protection of the land long-term  
* Less risk for businesses if housing changes

It’s designed to **protect people and relationships**, not create bureaucracy.

## **Conflict Resolution, Accountability & Community Care**

This community is committed to **safety, dignity, and repair**, while also holding clear boundaries around harmful behavior.

Conflict is understood as a natural part of shared life. **Harm is not normalized.**

## **Shared Agreements & Standards of Conduct**

All members, residents, visitors, and enterprises agree to uphold core community standards, including:

* Respectful communication  
* Nonviolence (verbal, emotional, physical)  
* Consent-based interactions  
* Accountability for impact, not just intent  
* Care for land, people, and shared resources

These agreements apply **regardless of role, tenure, or contribution level**.

## **What Constitutes a Breach of Agreement**

Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Verbal abuse, harassment, or intimidation  
* Physical violence or threats of violence  
* Sexual harm or boundary violations  
* Repeated disregard for shared agreements  
* Misuse of power, resources, or decision-making roles  
* Behavior that endangers people, land, or the viability of the community

Severity and context matter, and responses are **proportionate**.

## **Levels of Response (Graduated & Appropriate)**

### **1\. Direct Resolution (When Appropriate)**

* Encouraged for **low-impact or early-stage conflicts**

## **Closing Intention**

This project is grounded in:

* Clear agreements  
* Shared stewardship  
* Regenerative livelihoods  
* Security for contributors  
* Belonging with boundaries  
* Building something that can outlast any one person

As this project continues to take shape, pathways for participation will be shared **clearly, intentionally, and by invitation**.

**Anchor Circle \-** A rotating group responsible for values alignment, cross-pillar coordination, and whole-system coherence.

**Blooming Period \-** A provisional phase where contributors build trust and demonstrate alignment before gaining membership or equity.

**Community Pool of Funds \-** A shared fund supported by rent and revenue contributions, used for land care, infrastructure, community needs, and payouts.

**Equity \-** Recognition of contribution that confers stability, influence within one’s role, and eligibility for payout \- not speculative land ownership.

**Membership \-** Earned or invited belonging that comes with defined rights and responsibilities.

**Non-Speculative Land \-** Land held for use and care, not for profit through resale or appreciation.

**Pillar \-** A functional domain (farm, café, retreat, venue, land care, etc.) with its own contributors and decision-making processes.

**Residential Community Fund \-** A fund supported by residential income and amenity fees, used for residential infrastructure and shared needs.

**Stewardship \-** Ongoing care, responsibility, and relationship to land, people, and systems

# **Phased Revenue & Income Pathway**

Unified Sanctuaries / Sol is designed as a **phased, diversified revenue ecosystem**, not a single business model. Income is generated gradually as infrastructure, capacity, and community grow, with each phase reducing risk and increasing stability.

The model intentionally:

* avoids dependence on a single revenue stream  
* prioritizes early, low-overhead income  
* builds toward higher-margin experiences that subsidize essential needs  
* reinvests surplus into land care, affordability, and community resilience

This creates a **durable, non-extractive economic base** capable of supporting both people and land over the long term.

## **Phase 0: Arrival, Communal Base & First Private Dwelling (at least)**

**Timeframe:** Move-in → first months on land

**Physical Reality:**

* **First private dwelling is built immediately upon move-in**  
* A **communal space** exists or is quickly established  
* Temporary facilities (outdoor kitchen, compost toilets, tents, vans) may support early needs

**Primary Goal:** Create immediate housing stability *and* a shared base of operations so life and income can begin right away.

### **Revenue That Can Begin Here**

* **Workshops & skill-shares**  
  * Permaculture, land stewardship, natural building, healing arts  
* **Small gatherings & circles**  
  * Day events, weekend intensives  
* **Visitor & traveler stays**  
  * Camping, vans, tiny homes on wheels  
* **Amenity-use contributions**  
  * Extended-stay fees for kitchen, showers, laundry  
* **Resident stewardship contributions**  
  * Monthly contributions from those living on-site  
* **Media & documentation work**  
  * Storytelling, filming, light production  
* **Grants / aligned capital**  
  * Early-stage land stewardship, education, and infrastructure support

**Why This Works**

# **Legal, Trust, Governance, Grants, Banking, Accounting, and Liability Considerations**

### **Decision Framework \+ Recommended Options to Explore (VT project; phased growth; events \+ campground)**

This section is meant to help our team (and advisors) understand the major structural choices for Sol / Unified Sanctuaries, given our intention to create **one land project with two distinct realms**:

* **Residential / Living Realm:** primarily homes \+ friends visiting

* **Commons / Enterprise Realm:** public events, campground, retreats, farm stand/café, and other enterprises

Because the Commons side will be higher activity and higher risk, we want structures that protect residential stability while keeping the Commons realm fundable, insurable, and operationally clear.

---

## **1\) The core design: one land, two realms, different governance**

Even though everything is part of one shared vision, these two realms have different needs:

**Residential Realm (lower activity / lower risk)**

* privacy, stability, home life

* shared infrastructure (roads, water/septic, microgrid)

* predictable finances (shared charges, reserves)

**Commons / Enterprise Realm (higher activity / higher risk)**

* public visitors, gatherings, campground operations

* more contracts, staff/contractors, permits, safety protocols

* higher insurance exposure

**Why this matters:** If we don’t design for different risk levels, the residential community can end up carrying the legal/financial burden of public-facing activity.

---

## **2\) The four layers we’re designing (simple “stack”)**

To keep this legible to community members, lenders, and funders, we can think in four layers:

### **A) Land-holding (mission protection)**

This is the “land container” that **owns the land permanently** and prevents speculation (no flipping; land isn’t treated as a wealth-extraction asset). In practice, this is often a **Community Land Trust (CLT)**—a mission-driven landholding organization that leases long-term use rights through ground leases—or a purpose-built trust that holds land for a defined mission.

### **B) Operations (where risk lives)**

This is who actually runs public-facing functions (events, campground, café, retreats). Most liability sits here, so we contain risk by using **separate operating entities** with strong insurance and clear contracts.

### **C) Governance (how decisions happen)**

This is how we make decisions in a values-aligned way while staying clear to outsiders. It includes realm-specific decision bodies and role-based influence (“those doing the work steer the ship”), plus clear checks and balances.

### **D) Earned stake \+ exit (liquidity without securities)**

This is how people can contribute (cash and non-cash) and build an earned stake—without creating “investment-like units” that look like securities—and still have clear exit pathways.

---

## **3\) Lending \+ grants: what funders and banks typically need**

### **Lenders generally want:**

* a clear borrower (who can sign, who manages money)

* predictable repayment sources (fees/leases, reserves)

* clear collateral (what secures the loan—land, buildings, lease rights)

* clear governance and budgets

### **Grantors generally want:**

* a clear public benefit (land stewardship, education, community resilience)

* a nonprofit recipient or fiscal sponsor (often required)

* confidence that grant funds won’t become private payouts

**Implication for Sol:** Grants tend to fit most naturally on the Commons/program side (education, stewardship, community benefit). Residential stability is often funded more cleanly through member contributions, housing financing, and shared charges.

---

## **4\) Liability \+ insurance: minimum containment (especially with events \+ campground)**

With public events and a campground, we need an explicit “liability firewall.” The clean baseline is:

* the landholder maintains landowner/leasing insurance

* each operator (campground/events, café, retreat programming, etc.) carries robust liability insurance and names the landholder as additional insured

* leases require insurance minimums and indemnity language

* we may use one dedicated “Events/Campground Operator” entity so claims don’t spill into other operations

**Key idea:** Landholding can be mission-driven and stable; the higher-risk activity sits in the operating layer.

---

## **5\) Banking \+ accounting clarity (how we avoid confusion)**

Early clarity here prevents years of mess. At minimum, we separate books/accounts for:

1. **Residential shared pool** (common charges \+ reserves for roads/water/microgrid/shared assets)

2. **Commons community pool** (enterprise lease revenue, revenue share, program income, grant income if applicable)

3. **Each operating entity** (events/campground operator, café operator, farm operator, etc.)

We also define revenue categories upfront so accountants and funders can understand them:

* ground lease / land stewardship fees (land use)

* common charges (shared infrastructure and reserves)

* program fees (retreats/workshops)

* lease payments (enterprises leasing space/use rights)

* revenue share to the commons pool

---

## **6\) The big structural choice: one landholder vs two landholders**

### **Option 1 — One landholder \+ two realm leases \+ separate governance \+ separate operations**

**What this means:** One landholding entity owns the whole property, then creates two long-term lease frameworks:

* a Residential ground lease (living-realm rules and fees)

* a Commons master lease (enterprise realm rules and payments)

Each realm has its own governance body, and all high-risk activities are run by separate operating entities.

**Pros**

* simplest title structure (one owner)

* typically easier early for banking and baseline insurance

* lower formation complexity upfront

* still allows strong separation through leases \+ operating entities

**Cons**

* because one entity owns the whole parcel, we must be very strong on:

  * insurance requirements

  * lease boundaries and enforcement

  * strict bookkeeping separation

* some lenders may still perceive blended risk because events/campground exist on the same overall property

**Best when**

* we want to move quickly and keep early legal overhead manageable

* we plan to achieve most risk separation through operating entities and insurance

---

### **Option 2 — Two landholders (Residential landholder \+ Commons landholder)**

**What this means:** Residential land is owned by one landholding entity, and Commons land is owned by a separate landholding entity.

**Pros**

* stronger asset firewall: commons risk is less likely to threaten residential land assets

* clearer underwriting story for lenders/insurers (stable residential vs high-activity commons)

* aligns with our intention that the Commons becomes high activity and higher risk over time

**Cons**

* requires legal separation of real estate interests (see Section 7\)

* more administrative overhead (two sets of governance, accounting, agreements)

* shared infrastructure still requires strong coordination agreements

**Best when**

* we are confident the Commons realm will be high-activity/high-risk

* we want maximum protection for residential stability and are willing to invest in cleaner legal separation early

---

## **7\) If we choose two landholders: three ways to separate the real estate in Vermont**

### **A) Subdivision (separate parcels)**

We create at least two legal parcels: Residential and Commons (and potentially more later).

**Pros:** clearest for lenders and insurers; strongest separation.  
 **Cons:** requires survey \+ municipal subdivision process; easements likely needed for shared access/utilities.

### **B) “Site condo” / Planned community (common-interest community structure)**

We define two “units/realms” within a recorded declaration and define shared vs limited-shared elements (e.g., shared road corridor; commons-only facilities).

**Pros:** can separate realms without a classic subdivision (depending on local practice); allows clear cost allocation by realm.  
 **Cons:** more documentation and association governance; in Vermont, true condos can have timing constraints around recording until certain construction completion—so a planned community approach is often more flexible for phased buildout.

### **C) Airspace lots \+ reciprocal easement agreement (REA)**

We create separate deeded 3D parcels/rights plus a robust agreement covering access, utilities, cost-sharing, and rules.

**Pros:** strong mixed-use separation without a typical condo/HOA feel; highly customizable.  
 **Cons:** most bespoke and legal-heavy; not all lenders are equally comfortable.

---

## **8\) Earned stake \+ exit: a clean approach that avoids securities risk**

We want people to contribute (including non-cash contributions) and build an earned stake over time—without creating investment-like “units.”

### **Recommended approach:**

**Residential:** people can own their home/structure, while land remains steward-owned. Exit happens through a **resale formula** (a clear pricing method that caps speculative appreciation while allowing the homeowner to recoup costs and approved improvements).  
 **Shared infrastructure and commons contributions:** track these as either:

* a **capital account** (a recorded balance of contributions that can be repaid under a written policy, often over time and subject to reserves), and/or

* a **member loan** (documented repayment terms)

**Why this helps:** it creates real liquidity pathways without “tradeable investment units,” and keeps the project aligned with non-speculative intent.

---

## **9\) Vermont planning note: phasing and permitting**

Because we intend 10+ homes and public-facing uses (events \+ campground), we should assume additional state-level review and permitting at some stage. We can still pilot at a smaller scale early, but we should design the structure so it can scale cleanly when we expand.

---

## **10\) Recommended options to explore first (best fit for our goals)**

Given our goals (values alignment, lender/grantor attractiveness, liability separation, clear banking/accounting, and earned stake without securities), we recommend exploring two pathways in parallel:

### **Path A (simpler start; strong separation through leases and operations)**

One landholder \+ two realm leases \+ separate governance bodies \+ separate operating entities.

### **Path B (maximum residential protection; best long-term fit if commons becomes high activity)**

Two landholders \+ a Vermont-appropriate real estate separation method (subdivision, planned community/site condo, or airspace \+ REA), plus separate operating entities.

---

## **11\) Practical next steps for the team**

1. Decide whether we are leaning toward Path A (fast start) or Path B (maximum firewall), or phasing from A → B over time.

2. Engage Vermont land-use counsel \+ survey support to evaluate subdivision vs planned community vs airspace \+ REA feasibility.

3. Meet with an insurance broker early to confirm minimum coverages for landholder, governance body, and events/campground operator.

4. Draft the “minimum agreements” needed to make boundaries real:

   * residential ground lease and rules

   * commons master lease and rules

   * enterprise/operator leases

   * shared infrastructure agreement (roads/utilities/microgrid)

   * governance charter (roles/circles/approvals)

   * capital account / member loan and exit policy

5. Create a one-page “structure diagram” for lenders/funders showing: who owns what, who operates what, where risk sits, and how money flows.
