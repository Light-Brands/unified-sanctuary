# **Unified Sanctuaries Vision  (12/3/24)**

& Summary of Nodes \- Farm, Living, Event Space, Retreat Center / Makers Space 

# **Short Description**

In the heart of nature, Unified Sanctuaries envisions an innovative tapestry—a collection of distinct, interconnected entities harmoniously coexisting on separate, adjacent plots of land. This concept comprises a permaculture farm, a vibrant community, an event venue available for rent, and a transformative retreat and healing arts center. Each plot stands alone yet collaborates seamlessly, embodying the essence of regeneration and accessibility.

## **The Farm:**

One of the cornerstones of this vision is the farm—a lush expanse where the earth is cultivated with care. Complete with fertile soil, orchards of fruit trees, fields of companion-planted veggies, pollinators, and hemp, barns, a gourmet mushroom grow, storage facilities, a compost operation, and a farm stand, it will symbolize our commitment to nurturing the land, with permaculture principles and regenerative agriculture guiding our process. A portion of the harvest will be allocated to feed the local home free population, embodying the project’s ethos of giving back to the community.

## **Community Living Space:**

Adjacent to the farm, a vibrant community of kindred spirits will reside, each of the 15+ households stewarding its own 1-2 acres of land. This environment will foster individuality within a supportive community framework. A central communal structure will serve as the hub for shared activities and basic needs to be met, i.e. cooking, bathing, bathrooms, laundry, etc.. These community members will play pivotal roles in the adjacent properties and businesses \- as partners, advisors, and / or operators.

## **Event Space for Rent:**

Unified Sanctuaries will offer an event space, indoor and outdoor, available for rent by aligned organizations, groups, entrepreneurs, artists, educators, and practitioners alike. Accessible through a thoughtful application process, this venue will serve as an affordable platform for local people and small businesses \- encouraging innovation, creativity, and meaningful collaborations within the community.

## **Retreat, Healing Arts, & Education Center:**

Adjacent to the farm and the community living space, the Retreat and Healing Arts Center will take shape—a sanctuary of transformation. Healing workshops, visual and performing arts events, and a variety of therapeutic modalities will find their place. Spa services (offered inside a bathhouse), art and nature therapy, and creative expression will be facilitated. A portion of the center will feature untouched land—a haven for exploration, camping, and self-expression, including areas where individuals are free to be naked, providing a legal and liberating environment for self-expression. Additionally, a percentage of every ticket sold, booking, and purchase made on site will go towards a scholarship fund to cover the cost of services, workshops, and events for those who cannot afford them. Social justice, equity, and access to healing, education, and pleasure will be interwoven into all programs, promoting understanding, compassion, and thrive-ability among our diverse guests.

## **The Vision of Regeneration and Accessibility:**

The essence of this vision lies in the profound "why:” a collective desire to regenerate ourselves, our communities, our bio region, our Earth; and to cultivate deeper connection in all of these relationships. 

Unified Sanctuaries is a living testament to accessible knowledge, showcasing the potential of learning by doing and the power of many hands making light work. We plan to begin with a phased approach to development and to grow into a thriving revenue-generating retreat center, farm, space for rent for events, and, most importantly, community.

This vision is an invitation to embrace the boundless possibilities of collaboration, community, and regeneration. The overarching intention is for Unified Sanctuaries to embody love, inclusivity, accessibility, learning, healing, and natural harmony; to foster a deep connection between individuals, communities, and the natural world.
