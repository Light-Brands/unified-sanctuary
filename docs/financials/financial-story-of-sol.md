# **THE FINANCIAL STORY OF SOL**

*A regenerative, multi-capital and multi-enterprise ecosystem rooted in people, place, and collective stewardship*

Sol is a **living ecosystem of interconnected revenue streams** that reinforce one another. Each of the four physical “pillars” (Farm/Edu/Cafe, Retreat/Healing Center/Spa, Event Venue, Community Living) produces revenue, but the engine is the culture, the **people**, the **programming**, and the **circular economy** that binds them into a coherent system.

Below is the high-level financial architecture.

# **II. The connective tissue \- village economy / rev streams, tokenomics, governance, & trust units to support liquidity upon exit**

These are system-wide streams that emerge *because the whole ecosystem exists*.

**The entrepreneurial nodes that early stewards are co-creating:**

1\. Farm & Value-Added Products Enterprise  
2\. Café / Culinary Arts Enterprise  
3\. Retreat & Healing Arts Enterprise  
4\. Bathhouse / Spa Enterprise  
5\. Event Venue Enterprise  
6\. Media Production & Storytelling Enterprise \+ Education  
7\. Natural Building & Regenerative Infrastructure Enterprise \+ Educatgion  
8\. Governance & Education Enterprise  
9\. Artisan Goods & Performing Arts Enterprise \+ Education

These enterprises create **diverse, resilient, multi-capital revenue flows**.

**Additional Streams**

* Media & IP Revenue, e.g. Permatours docuseries, royalties from performances, books, online courses, “Interactive museum of regenerative living” monetized through online content  
* Grants, flow funding, impact capital, e.g. research grants (soil, food systems, biochar), family foundation grants, government sustainability programs, Climate & soil carbon credits  
* Merch / Value-Added Producer Marketplace, e.g. Herbal products, locally sourced / made goods  
* Music & art 

### **1\. Sol Token Economy (Utility Token)**

* Tokens earned through contribution  
* Earned through hosting events, farm work, natural building, media contributions, volunteering, stewardship hours, etc.    
* Spent on food /cafe, bathhouse / retreat center offerings, classes / workshops, retreats, lodging, goods, AV services  
* Circulates value internally (keeps money local)  
* Drives higher participation and volunteerism  
* Can also be purchased by visitors (revenue)  
* No liquid yet b/c:  
  * Reduces legal/financial complexity  
  * Maintains values integrity  
  * Avoids speculation  
  * Keeps wealth circulating inside the village  
  * Lowers operational barriers

### **2\. Voice Token (Governance Token)**

* Represent *participation, contribution, and responsibility*, not wealth.  
* Earned through:  
  * Stewardship  
  * Long-term participation  
  * Demonstrated alignment  
  * Showing up for the community  
  * Completing training pathways  
  * Holding roles  
* Used for:  
  * Governance  
  * Decision-making  
  * Choosing Circle representatives  
  * Approving budgets  
  * Shaping culture \+ agreements  
* They cannot  
  * Be bought, sold, traded, inherited, accumulate too much power (can have a limit re how many voice tokens can be used in a given proposal)

### **2\. Contribution Units (equity-like, non-speculative)**

* For long-term stewards/investors/contributors  
* Liquidated at book value \+ Consumer Price Index (CPI)  
* No speculation → stabilizes the community financially  
  * **Value cannot be traded, flipped, or inflated artificially**  
    * No one benefits from rising land values or speculation  
  * **Protects the community from gentrification**  
    * Because Unit value grows only with real improvements, not market hype.  
  * **Ensures fairness \+ equity**  
    * People who build value get rewarded—but no one extracts excess profit.  
  * **NOT an investment product**  
    * It’s recognition for stewardship, not a stock or share.

This preserves your principles: *low-extraction, slow-money, real-value growth, deeply equitable.*

### **3\. Autonomy of Nodes**

Each micro-enterprise (farm, café, retreat center, natural building crew, etc.) has:

* Its own mini-budget  
* Its own leadership circle  
* Its own way of operating  
* Its own revenue and accountability  
* Its own internal agreements

As long as they align with the founding values, principles, and ecological/social commitments of the Trust. This is your polycentric governance system \- unified values, autonomous nodes.

# **IV. Interdependence of Pillars: How They Financially Support Each Other**

Sol is designed to have a **circular economy** (seen in the graphic in the deck w/ hubs connected by arrows \+ token loop).

Here’s how the financial loops reinforce themselves:

### **Farm → Café → Retreats → Lodging**

* Food grown onsite is sold to the café  
* Café feeds retreat guests  
* Retreat guests stay in lodging → generates income → funds more farm beds  
* Waste returns to compost → soil → more production

### **Event Venue → Media → Storytelling → Visitors → Sales**

* Big events create footage for storytelling  
* Storytelling attracts more visitors  
* Visitors buy products, book retreats, attend workshops  
* This grows every other pillar

### **Community Living → Labor Force → Reduced OpEx**

* Residents contribute labor for Tokens  
* Tokens re-enter the local economy  
* Less cash is needed to maintain operations and feed / house / reward people  
* Higher resilience and lower cost structure

### **Healing Center → Bathhouse → Café → Farm**

* Wellness guests stay onsite  
* Buy café meals  
* Purchase herbal products  
* Feed revenue back to farm \+ people

### **Permatours Integration**

* Permatours brings volunteers → reduces labor costs  
* Permatours brings marketing power → more event ticket sales  
* Permatours brings aligned partnerships → more donors

# **V. Unified Story Summary**

### **Sol is a diversified, multi-revenue regenerative village with:**

* 4 physical revenue pillars / autonomous nodes that support a variety of businesses   
* 9+ human-centered micro-enterprises  
* A circular economy that keeps wealth local  
* A governance model that protects affordability & long-term resilience  
* Built-in media engine for global reach  
* Retreat \+ venue capacity that generates high-value revenue

### **Why this works financially**

* Multi-season revenue (summer farm, fall festivals, winter bathhouse, year-round therapy).  
* Multi-asset leverage (land, buildings, talent, media).  
* High alignment with trends in regenerative tourism, wellness, experiential education.
