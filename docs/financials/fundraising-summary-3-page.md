**Unified Sanctuaries**

*A Living Blueprint for Regenerative Living & Community Resilience*

**Our Intention**

Unified Sanctuaries is an experimental hub for learning \- a living lab and museum \- where new and ancient ways of healing the Earth, people, and communities are explored. Through permaculture farming, healing arts, community living, and education, we are co-creating a regenerative model of village-scale living, rooted in equity, Indigenous wisdom, and ecological stewardship. This thriving sanctuary is designed for people to reconnect with the Earth, themselves, and each other.

Our intention is for this project to serve as  a blueprint for other villages, regenerative neighborhoods, and intentional communities. All governance frameworks, economic models, and lessons learned will be openly shared to support the global movement for regenerative living.

**Unified Sanctuaries operates through interconnected platforms—each an autonomous node within the larger ecosystem:**

* **Permaculture Farm & Education Center** – A hub for regenerative agriculture, food sovereignty, and hands-on learning.  
* **Retreat & Healing Arts Center** – A sanctuary for restoration, creative expression, holistic therapies, and hands-on innovation, also featuring a makerspace for crafts, art, and regenerative design experimentation.  
* **Event Venue** – A gathering space for knowledge-sharing, artistic collaboration, and cultural events.  
* **Community Living Space** – A vibrant village supporting shared stewardship and cooperative living.

**Our Governance & Structure**

Unified Sanctuaries is a community-owned and governed ecosystem that empowers self-governance, inspired action, and leadership. Our governance model honors autonomy and ensures that all contributors can have a meaningful role in shaping and sustaining this evolving ecosystem.

More specifically, each platform—whether the Permaculture Farm & Education Center, Retreat & Healing Arts Center, Event Venue, or Community Living Space—operates autonomously, deciding how it rewards contributions, compensates participants, and structures its internal governance. However, all platforms remain interconnected through shared infrastructure, economic systems, and core values of regenerative stewardship.

To maintain coherence, an Anchor Circle (a.k.a. a Council) serves as a guiding light to uphold shared values, facilitate collaboration, and provide mutual support between platforms. While each platform has decision-making autonomy, the Anchor Circle cultivates participatory governance, shared leadership, and co-creation across the broader Unified Sanctuaries ecosystem.

To support participation and long-term investment in the community:

* Contributors earn community currency (tokens), which can be exchanged for goods, services, and experiences within the ecosystem.  
* Those who contribute to increasing property value through infrastructure development and long-term improvements earn units in a trust. These units represent their capital contribution and allow them to liquidate upon exit—ensuring regenerative development is rewarded.  
* Each platform retains autonomy in determining its contribution-reward mechanisms while remaining part of the broader Unified Sanctuaries ecosystem, ensuring a balance between independence and interdependence.

This governance structure allows for decentralized decision-making while ensuring collective alignment, resource-sharing, and long-term sustainability through the Anchor Circle’s guiding presence.

**Where We Are in Development**

Our intention is to inspire participation, empowering people to take initiative, lead, and shape this vision collectively. Unified Sanctuaries is currently focusing on:

* **Land Acquisition & Partnerships**: Identifying and securing a multi-acre property to host our regenerative community and shared infrastructure.  
* **Governance**: Further refining our governance framework for how contributors earn decision-making power, which blends sociocracy, and holacracy.  
* **Funding & Suppor**t: Engaging with donors, impact investors, and grantmakers to resource our vision.  
* **Infrastructure & Planning:** Designing the phased development of key platforms.  
* **Community Building**: Growing our network of aligned collaborators, including permaculturists, wellness practitioners, builders, and social impact entrepreneurs.
