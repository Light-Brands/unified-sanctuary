  
***MISSION*** 

*Unified Sanctuaries Pilot Village is a regenerative, land-based community committed to solving for each other's basic needs of food,housing, and community within a supportive, earth-friendly environment.* 

*Permaculture, regenerative agriculture, and restoring biodiversity and soil health are pillars of our work, as well as connection \- connection to self, Earth, community, and our bioregion.*  

*Connection will be cultivated via the co-creation of platforms \- the first 4 being a permaculture farm and education center, retreat and healing arts center, event venue, and community living space. Each will be designed to support sharing gifts and art, wisdom and teachings, feelings and desires, challenges and traumas, business offerings, experiments, innovations, and more.* 

*We will cooperatively govern the project and community, prioritizing the common good of all, especially Mother Earth.  We’ll provide accessible pathways for participation, so that those rich in alternative forms of capital can earn equity and decision making power, as well as products and services offered onsite by community members.* 

*This project will be a hub for regenerative economy, bioregional learning and financing, and healing arts.* 

*Together, we’ll strive to remember, return, and embrace all that life has to offer, including modern technology that reduces our environmental impact and increases the depth of our connections.* 

***VISION*** 

*Unified Sanctuaries envisions a vibrant, regenerative future where communities live in harmony with the Earth and each other.* 

*Unified Sanctuaries will serve as an open source blueprint, living laboratory, and museum for earth-friendly structures, permaculture gardens, and supportive community living practices.* 

*The foundation of our infrastructure will be built collaboratively through learn-by-doing festivals, which we'll film to make accessible for online learners.* 

*We envision supporting a network of eco-villages that share knowledge and resources. We also plan to serve as a bioregional finance facility and learning center, acting as a hub for local organizing efforts, regenerative economies, and place-based education.* 

*Our vision is brought to life through four interconnected platforms, to start:*

*A Community Living Space: A neighborhood of 20+ homes, plus a community center offering amenities for traveler friends and visitors.*

*A Permaculture Farm: A thriving agricultural hub cultivating fruits, vegetables, medicinal and culinary herbs, and mushrooms. The farm will feature a farm stand and storefront, food preservation facilities, and farm-to-table dining experiences. Agritourism and educational opportunities will be abundant.*

*A Retreat & Healing Arts Center: Spaces for restoration and creative expression, including a spa and bathhouse, wellness areas, a campground, a dance space, a visual arts studio, a makerspace, and a storefront for community-made products.*

*An Event Venue: A state-of-the-art space equipped with A/V and event production services, serving as a gathering place for learning, collaboration, creativity, expression, and celebration.*

*Our vision includes demonstrating the power of regenerative community living to meet basic needs and support the thrive-ability of its members. We'll strive to integrate modern technology and ancient indigenous technology and wisdom to create a sanctuary of sanctuaries that educates, heals, and uplifts \- serving as a beacon of hope for a more regenerative and equitable future for all.*

***ABOUT*** 

*Unified Sanctuaries is a regenerative, land-based community-in-the-making being designed to explore and embody ways of living, both new and old, that align with the Earth’s rhythms and honor collective well-being. More than a place, it will be a living experiment—a sanctuary for individuals and families to co-create, learn, and thrive while cultivating deep connections to self, community, and nature.*

*We embrace village living as a model for shared responsibility and stewardship. Our community members will collectively care for the land and ensure the health of the village and its members.* 

*This sanctuary will serve as a place for remembering who we are and returning home—a home that is both physical and spiritual, where community members can reconnect with the Earth and each other while leveraging modern tools to support a regenerative and harmonious way of life. By combining the wisdom of traditional practices with contemporary technology, Unified Sanctuaries will bridge past and future in service of a healthier present.*

*We’ll prioritize serving life over profit while ensuring the financial health of the community and its projects.This project is being built on a foundation of trust, equity, and collaboration, where resources will be shared, decisions will be made collectively, and the land will be cared for as a shared responsibility.*

*Unified Sanctuaries will serve as a living, breathing example of what is possible when people come together with a vision for a regenerative future—one that uplifts individuals, strengthens communities, and heals the planet.*

***GOVERNANCE*** 

*Unified Sanctuaries' governance will be grounded in the indigenous principles of reciprocity, respect, responsibility, and reverence for all living beings. We'll prioritize autonomy, collaboration, and accountability, ensuring that each platform \- the farm, retreat and healing arts center, venue, and community living space \- operates independently while remaining aligned with the overarching vision and values of the community.*

*Platform-Specific Governance*

*Each platform within Unified Sanctuaries will establish its own governance structures tailored to its unique needs and operations \- allowing for flexibility and innovation, while upholding the shared principles of the project.*

*The Anchor Circle*

*To maintain alignment and cohesion across platforms, Unified Sanctuaries will be guided by an Anchor Circle, consisting of the project’s core stewards. As the 4 platforms develop, they will each elect a representative to take part in the Anchor Circle, ensuring that each platform has a voice in the community’s shared direction and decisions.*

*The Anchor Circle will:*

* *Facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing across platforms*  
* *Uphold the mission, vision, and values of Unified Sanctuaries*  
* *Serve as the liaison between individual platforms and the trust*

*Trustees and Fiduciary Oversight*

*The Trustees will assume fiduciary responsibility for Unified Sanctuaries, bearing the risks and oversight of major decisions that impact the project’s financial health and longevity. Trustees will review and approve significant property developments, expenditures, and investments.*

*The Trustees will select its Trust Managers (also called the Anchor Circle members).*

*Collaborative Decision-Making*

*Unified Sanctuaries will strive for decisions to be inclusive, transparent, and guided by the collective wisdom of the larger community. Each platform’s representative in the Anchor Circle will amplify the voices and needs of their platform while contributing to the broader vision of the sanctuary.*

*By integrating platform autonomy with shared governance through the Anchor Circle, Unified Sanctuaries will create a system that is resilient and adaptive, prioritizing the common good of all members while ensuring the health and harmony of the greater community.*

*Conflict Resolution and Restorative Justice*

*Unified Sanctuaries will uphold a commitment to restorative justice as a cornerstone of its governance. When conflicts arise, our process will emphasize:*

* *Open Dialogue: Providing safe spaces for honest communication, ensuring that all voices are heard and respected.*  
* *Community Mediation: Engaging trained mediators to facilitate understanding and resolution.*  
* *Repair and Reconnection: Focusing on healing relationships and addressing the root causes of conflict to restore harmony.*

*These practices will reflect our values of compassion, unity, and respect, aiming to strengthen community bonds and ensure accountability in ways that honors the dignity of all involved.*

*This approach to conflict resolution will align with Indigenous principles of reciprocity and collective responsibility, ensuring that challenges become opportunities for growth and deeper connection within the community.*

***INCENTIVES*** 

*Unified Sanctuaries is committed to creating a culture of collaboration, equity, and regeneration by rewarding diverse forms of contribution. Through innovative tools like a utility token, platform-specific incentives, and opportunities to build equity through non-cash contributions, we strive for everyone’s efforts—whether time / labor, skills, assets or other resources—are recognized and valued.*

### *Unified Token: A Community Currency*

*The Unified Token will serve as an internal utility currency to incentivize participation and build a regenerative local economy. Contributors to Unified Sanctuaries—whether through labor, skill-sharing, assets, or services—will earn Unified Tokens. These tokens will be used to purchase products and services from businesses operating onsite (e.g. coffee, tomatoes, massages, etc.) as well as to participate in community events and workshops.*

*This token system will be designed to reduce reliance on government-issued currency, promote circular exchanges within the community, and reward meaningful contributions to the project.*

### *Platform-Specific Incentives*

### *Trust Units: Earning Long-Term Equity*

*Contributors who enhance the value of the property—whether through infrastructure development, significant project contributions, or ecological improvements—will earn units in the private trust. These units will represent long-term equity in Unified Sanctuaries \- reflecting the value someone has created and enabling them to liquidate their trust units upon exit (in some cases over time, based on the property’s value and available resources).*

### *Encouraging Participation and Collaboration*

*These diverse incentives are intended to ensure that those who invest in the long-term health and value of Unified Sanctuaries are rewarded with immediate and enduring benefits, cultivating deeper engagement and a shared sense of ownership.*

*Whether someone is growing food, building infrastructure, hosting events, or providing services, their efforts will be recognized in ways that strengthen their connection to the community and its resources.*
